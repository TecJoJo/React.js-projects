        This project further enhanced my understanding regarding the usages of
        hooks like useState, useEffect, useRef. In addition, I practiced
        fetching API data from unsplash.com. I also have a better understanding
        of the URL-parameters. I had learnt some new topics during this project,
        for example, how to add custom environment variables. I think it is also
        important to be able to utilize the Opensource codes on the internet.
        So, I decided to add this amazing modal-window made by GitHub user
        crackayus09(https://github.com/crackayus09/react-dock-modal) instead of
        writing on my own from scratch.

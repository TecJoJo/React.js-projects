This project further enhanced my understanding regarding the usages of hooks like useState, useEffect, useRef. In addition, I practiced fetching API data from unsplash.com. I also have a better understanding of the URL-parameters.  
I had learnt some new topics during this project, for example, how to add custom environment variables.
I think it is also important to be able to utilize the Opensource codes on the internet. So, I decided to add this amazing modal-window made by GitHub user crackayus09(https://github.com/crackayus09/react-dock-modal) instead of writing on my own from scratch.
Close the modal window to explore the functionality of this website.
